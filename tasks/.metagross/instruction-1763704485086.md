# Metagross Instruction (stage=plan)

1. Review the project documentation in /home/ethan/ethanstoner-portfolio/tasks/docs to ensure a thorough understanding of the requirements and constraints. 2. Develop a detailed plan including a summary of key goals, architecture highlights, and critical constraints. 3. Create a development plan with ordered phases and milestones. 4. Compile a TODO board with a numbered checklist of implementation tasks. 5. Identify any open questions or risks that need clarification. 6. Confirm understanding of the execution contract, especially the requirement for Docker-only execution and mandatory test gates. 7. Provide the structured planning response with all the required sections.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
