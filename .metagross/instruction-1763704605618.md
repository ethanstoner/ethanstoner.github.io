# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Conduct a comprehensive stuck recovery audit by answering the six audit questions provided. Identify the root cause of the repeated task failures, analyze past attempts, and determine real blockers. Decide on the best course of action, whether it's fixing the root blocker, shipping the current state with documented limitations, or requesting human intervention. Generate a final evidence block with the current test status, coverage, known limitations, and recommended next steps.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
