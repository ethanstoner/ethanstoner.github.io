# Metagross Instruction (stage=plan)

Investigate the recurring issue causing the cursor-agent to exit with code 1 by checking the logs for detailed error messages or stack traces. Once identified, attempt to resolve the issue and restart the cursor-agent. After ensuring it is functioning correctly, proceed with the planning phase as previously instructed, ensuring to read all relevant documentation and provide a structured planning response including Summary, Development Plan, TODO Board, and Open Questions/Risks.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
