# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

🚨 SUPERVISOR OVERRIDE: STUCK PATTERN DETECTED

After 68 iterations, you appear stuck in an infinite loop with no progress.
The continuous delivery directive states: "If stuck on same task >3 iterations without progress: document blockers, ship current state with known limitations."

**STUCK RECOVERY AUDIT - Answer These Questions:**

1. **Why Am I Stuck? (Root Cause Analysis)**
   - What specific task am I repeating without progress?
   - What metric or requirement am I trying to achieve?
   - What prevents me from achieving it?
   - Is the requirement achievable? Or is there a fundamental blocker?

2. **What Have I Tried? (Iteration Analysis)**
   - What approaches have I attempted in the last 10 iterations?
   - Why did each approach fail?
   - Am I repeating the same approach expecting different results?

3. **What Are The REAL Blockers? (Be Honest)**
   - Test infrastructure issues? (async/mocking problems)
   - Missing configuration? (API keys, secrets, connection strings)
   - Impossible requirements? (project spec demands 85% but blockers prevent it)
   - Architectural limitations? (code design makes testing hard)
   - External dependencies? (waiting for third-party services)

4. **What Can I Control vs Cannot Control?**
   - CAN control: Code changes, test additions, refactoring, documentation
   - CANNOT control: Fundamental infrastructure issues requiring human intervention
   - CANNOT control: Conflicting requirements (project spec vs Metagross contract)

5. **What Are My Options? (Alternative Approaches)**
   - Option A: Fix the root blocker first, then continue
   - Option B: Ship current state with documented limitations
   - Option C: Alternative approach that avoids the blocker
   - Option D: Request human intervention for blocker

6. **Decision: What Should I Do RIGHT NOW?**

**Metagross Execution Contract (Your Authority):**
- Test coverage: Acceptable if >50% and core business logic is tested
- Quality metrics (85%, 70%, etc.) are TARGETS, not blockers
- Priority: Working software over perfect metrics
- If blocked by infrastructure: Ship current state, document blocker for follow-up
- If conflicting requirements: Metagross contract overrides project specs

**Required Actions:**

1. Answer the 6 audit questions above comprehensively
2. Make a clear decision on how to proceed
3. If shipping: Generate FINAL evidence block with:
   - tests_passed: true/false (actual status)
   - coverage: <actual %> (do NOT lie)
   - known_limitations: [detailed list of blockers]
   - recommended_next_steps: [what human should do post-ship]
4. Explain your decision and rationale

**This is a STUCK RECOVERY instruction. Think critically, analyze honestly, and make the best decision based on available options.**
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
