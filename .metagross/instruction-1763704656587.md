# Metagross Instruction (stage=plan)

Investigate the root cause of the cursor-agent exiting with code 1 by examining the logs and stack traces for any error messages. Once identified, attempt to resolve the issue and re-run the planning phase. Ensure that you thoroughly read the project documentation in the specified directories and the execution contract in `.cursorrules`. Then, provide a structured planning response with the required sections: Summary, Development Plan, TODO Board, and Open Questions/Risks. Make sure to cite specific documents when referencing requirements to demonstrate your understanding.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
