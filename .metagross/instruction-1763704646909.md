Investigate the cause of the cursor-agent exiting with code 1 by checking the logs for any error messages or stack traces that might indicate the problem. Once identified, attempt to resolve the issue and re-run the planning phase. Ensure that you thoroughly read the project documentation in the specified directories and the execution contract in `.cursorrules`. Then, provide a structured planning response with the required sections: Summary, Development Plan, TODO Board, and Open Questions/Risks. Make sure to cite specific documents when referencing requirements to demonstrate your understanding.
