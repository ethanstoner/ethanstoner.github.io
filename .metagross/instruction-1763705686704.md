# Metagross Instruction (stage=plan)

Attempt to access and read the contents of the file '/home/ethan/ethanstoner-portfolio/tasks/fix_tech_stack.md' using the command 'cat /home/ethan/ethanstoner-portfolio/tasks/fix_tech_stack.md'. Once you have the contents, provide a detailed plan including a summary, development plan, TODO board, and open questions or risks. If you encounter any issues accessing the file or understanding its contents, report them immediately. Ensure to capture the output and provide it in the required evidence block format.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
